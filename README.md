# ES-dRNN
Short Term Load Forecasting with ES-dRNN

Code and data accompanying paper "ES-dRNN: A Hybrid Exponential Smoothing andDilated Recurrent Neural Network Model forShort-Term Load Forecasting", https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02663


# File structure
--The folder "data" contains the orginal data the algorithm will learn and make forecast from
--The folder "output/23" will include the load forecast to be learned
--The file "es_drnn.py" is the main function file for the forecasting
